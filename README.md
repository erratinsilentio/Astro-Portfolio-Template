  "Creative Web Developer, Frontend Developer, Full Stack Developer";

// Home Page
export const HOME_LOGO = "üëæ";
export const HOME_HEADER_TITLE = "erratinsilentio";
export const HOME_HEADER_SUBTITLE = "Creative Web Developer";

  {
    icon: "‚öúÔ∏è",
    text: "Working on the Frontend, interested in all kinds of tech",
  },
  { icon: "‚öúÔ∏è", text: "Always ready to put in the work - both smart & hard" },
